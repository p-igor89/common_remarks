<p>Hey there, friend!</p>

<p>
  🎉 Welcome aboard <strong>common-remarks</strong> — a cozy corner where I rant,
  reflect, and occasionally make sense of life, work, and everything in between.
  <br /><br />
  But before I flood your inbox with automation tales, spicy bugs, and deep thoughts from 3AM debugging sessions,
  I just need one thing — hit the button below to confirm that it was actually <b>*you*</b> who signed up and not your cat stepping on the keyboard. 🐾

<p>So, what’s coming your way?</p>

<p>
  🧪 Semi-regular musings about testing, automation, and this thing we call work.<br />
  🧠 Occasional wisdom (or nonsense) about life and productivity.<br />
  🚀 Behind-the-scenes notes that don’t make it to LinkedIn.<br />
  ☕️ And if you're feeling kind, you can always buy me a coffee to fuel more midnight rants.
