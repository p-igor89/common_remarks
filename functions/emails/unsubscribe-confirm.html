<p>Hey there,</p>

<p>
  So... you're unsubscribing from <strong>common-remarks</strong>.
  No hard feelings — I get it! 🙌 Life gets wild, inboxes overflow, and sometimes you just need a breather from long-winded rants about testing, productivity, and existential tech crises.
</p>

<p>
  If you ever feel like coming back for another round of reflections, nerdy notes, or random stories from the trenches — I’ll be here, probably with coffee and a bug I still can’t reproduce ☕🐛
</p>

  Just to be sure this wasn’t an accidental click or a cat walking across your keyboard, please confirm by hitting the button below:
